# IBM Data Science Capstone

This repository contains the final project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program. The capstone project integrates and applies the data science tools, methodologies, and skills learned throughout the course. The goal of this project is to solve a real-world problem using data science techniques.

## Project Overview
In this capstone, we explore a specific data science problem by applying various machine learning algorithms, data cleaning techniques, and data visualization tools. The project steps include:

- **Data Collection:** Acquiring and preprocessing the dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying patterns and relationships in the data.
- **Modeling:** Applying machine learning models to predict outcomes.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance and optimizing accuracy.
- **Reporting:** Summarizing insights, challenges, and results.

## Key Files
- **Notebook.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis and project workflow.
- **Data/**: Folder with raw and processed data.
- **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions.
- **Results/**: Contains output files, visualizations, and final reports.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc.)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- IBM Watson Studio
- GitHub for version control
